Task: create a virtual machine in VirtualBox under specific instructions and then set up an own operating system while implementing strict rules.

Turn in: signature.txt file at the root of the repository. Signiture of the machine's virtual disk needs to be in the file. // .
	To get this signature:
	- open default installation folder: /Users/edavid/VirtualBox VMs/edavid42 // .
	- retrieve the signature from the .vdi file of your virtual machine in sha1 format with the following command: shasum <filename>, example output: 6e657c4619944be17df3c31faa030c25e43e40af // .

Mandatory part: Set up first server by following specific rules
As an operating system, I'll use Debian as I'm new to system administration // !
	- SELinux must be running at startup and its configuration has to be adapted for the project's needs. // !
	- AppArmor for Debian must be running at startup too. // !
	- Must create at least 2 encrypted partitions using LVM. Find example on this in the pdf (page 5) // !
	- Learn difference between aptitude and apt // !

An SSH service will be running on port 4242 only. For security reasons, it must not be possible to connect to using SSH as root. // .
	- The use of SSH will be tested during defense by setting up a new account. // !
	- Have to configure the operating system with the UTW firewall and thus leave only port 4242 open. // !
	- The firewall must be active when launching the virtual machine. // .

The hostname of the virtual machine must be intra login ending with 42 (edavid42). Will have to modify this hostname during evaluation. // .
Have to implement a strong password policy. // .
Have to install and configure sudo following strict rules. // .
In addition to the root user, a user with my login as username has to be present, this user has to belong to the user42 and sudo groups. // .
During the defense, will have to create a new user and assign it to a group. // .

Password policy rules:
	- PW has to expire every 30 days // .
	- Minimum number of days allowed before modification of a PW will be set to 2 // .
	- User has to receive a warning message 7 days before the PW expires // .
	- PW must be at least 10 characters long. Must contain an uppercase letter and a number. Must not contain more than 3 consecutive identical characters // .
	- PW must not include the name of the user // .
	- The following rule does not apply to the root PW: The PW must have at least 7 characters that are not part of the former password. // .
	- Root PW has to comply with this policy // .
After setting up the configuration files, will have to change all the passwords of the accounts present on the Virtual Machine, including root account. // .

To set up a strong configuration for the sudo group, will have to comply the following requirements:
	- Authentication using sudo has to be limited to 3 attempts in the event of an incorrect password // .
	- Custom message of my choice has to be displayed if an error due to a wrong password occurs when using sudo // .
	- Each action using sudo has to be archived, both inputs and outputs. The log file has to be saved in the /var/log/sudo/ folder // .
	- The TTY mode has to be enabled for security reasons // !
	- For security reasons, the paths that can be used by sudo must be restricted, ex.: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin // .

Create a script, called monitoring.sh, which must be developed in bash.
This script will display some information on all terminals every 10 minutes. The banner is optional. No error must be visible.
Display following informations:
	- Architecture of the operating system and its kernel version
	- Number of physical processors
	- Number of virtual processors
	- Current available RAM on the server and its utilization rate as a percentage
	- Current available memory on the server and its utilization rate as a percentage
	- Current utilization rate of the processors as a percentage
	- Date and time of last reboot
	- Whether LVM is active or not 
	- Number of active connections
	- Number of users using the server
	- IPv4 address of the server and its MAC (Media Access Control) address
	- Number of commands executed with the sudo program
During the defense, I'll have to explain how this script works. Also have to be able to interrupt it without modifying it. Take a look at cron // !
