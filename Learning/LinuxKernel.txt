The Linux Kernel is a free and open-source:
	- monolithic: OS architecture where the entire OS is working in kernel space.
	- modular: modularity in design is a design principle that subdivides a system into smaller parts called modules, which can be independently created, modified, replaced, or exchanged with
		other modules or between different systems.
	- multitasking: concurrent execution of multiple tasks over a certain period of time. New tasks can interrupt already started ones before they finish, instead of waiting for them to end.
		As a result, a computer executes segments of multiple tasks in an interleaved manner, while the tasks share common processing resources such as CPUs and main memory.
	- Unix-like operating system kernel.
		// Unix-like: OS that behaves in a manner similar to a Unix-system, while not necessarily conforming to or being certified to any version of the Single UNIX Specification.
		// kernel: a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and has complete control over everything in the system. It is the "portion of the operating system code that is always
		//	resident in memory", and facilitates interactions between hardware and software components.
