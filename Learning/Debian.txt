Debian (aka Debian GNU/Linux) is a linux distributed established by Ian Murdock in 1993. One of the oldest OS based on the Linux kernel.
The Debian Stable branch is the most popular edition for personal computers and servers. Debian is also the basis for many other distributions, most notably Ubuntu.
Three branches of Debian are regularly maintained:
	- Stable (need to use in project): current release and targets stable and well-tested software needs. Its made by freezing Testing for a few months where bugs are fixed and packages
		with too many bugs are removed; then the resulting system is released as stable.
	- Testing: preview branch that will eventually become the next major release. The packages in this branch have had some testing in unstable but they may not be fit for release yet.
		It contains newer packages than Stable but older than Unstable.
	- Unstable: always codenamed 'sid', is the trunk (refers to the unnamed branch - version - of a file tree under revision control). Packages are accepted without checking the distribution as a whole.
		This branch is usually run by software developers who participate in a project and need the latest libraries available, and by those who prefer bleeding-edge (technology so new that they could
		have a high risk of being unreliable and lead adopters to incur greater expense in order to make use of them) software.
