Security-Enchanced Linux (SELinux) is a Linux kernel security module that provides a mechanism for supporting access control security policies, including mandatory access controls (MAC).
	// access control: selective restriction of access to a place or other resource, while access management describes the process
	// permission to access a resource is called authorization
	// MAC: refers to a type of access control by which the OS or DB constrains the ability of a subject or initiator to access or generally perform some sort of operation on an object or target.

SELinux is a set of kernel modifications and user-space tools that have been added to various Linux distributions. Its architecture strives to separate enforcement of security decisions from the
security policy, and streamlines the amount of software involved with security policy enforcement.
