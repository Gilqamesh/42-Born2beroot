The Linux Kernel is a free and open-source:
	- monolithic: OS architecture where the entire OS is working in kernel space.
	- modular: modularity in design is a design principle that subdivides a system into smaller parts called modules, which can be independently created, modified, replaced, or exchanged with
		other modules or between different systems.
	- multitasking: concurrent execution of multiple tasks over a certain period of time. New tasks can interrupt already started ones before they finish, instead of waiting for them to end.
		As a result, a computer executes segments of multiple tasks in an interleaved manner, while the tasks share common processing resources such as CPUs and main memory.
	- Unix-like operating system kernel.
		// Unix-like: OS that behaves in a manner similar to a Unix-system.
